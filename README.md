# Project PLAYLIST

Welcome to the project PLAYLIST, where you can make the playlist of your dreams! Biuld your own playlist by searching for songs that simply waiting to be plucked from their APIs (Amazing Playlist Interims). If you find the song, you're looking for, simply add it to your playlist! But the fun doesn't end there, you can remove songs, comment on other user's playlists, and even remove your own playlists and add your own custom artwork!
